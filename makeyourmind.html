                <p class="essay-section">
                    There are a lot of false things being said about me online, and I want to address them clearly in one place.
                    I am writing this because I am tired of people repeating accusations that are either completely false or
                    heavily twisted.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    This post is not drama bait. It is just a direct response to claims that keep getting spread around as if they are facts.
                </p>

                <div class="note-box">
                    <p class="essay-section" style="margin: 0;">
                        <strong>Please read this fully before repeating rumors.</strong> A lot of the stuff being said about me leaves out basic context.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2 class="subheading">1) The NSFW channel claim</h2>
                <p class="essay-section">
                    One of the biggest false claims is about the Discord server for <strong>Poke</strong> (the YouTube front-end I made).
                    Yes, there was an NSFW channel in that server.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    What people keep leaving out is the important part: <strong>it was locked behind an age gate / restricted channel</strong>.
                    It was not public to everyone, and it was not being shown to minors by default.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    Some people tried to spin this into “you were showing NSFW content to minors,” which is simply not true.
                    The channel was restricted. If someone lied about their age to get access, that is not something I could magically detect.
                    I did not intentionally expose minors to NSFW content.
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">2) The “k” accusation</h2>
                <p class="essay-section">
                    Another rumor involves someone I will call <strong>k</strong>.
                    We were friends. We talked a lot, got along really well, and they even made me a profile picture.
                    It was a normal online friendship.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    At one point, they sent me a smooching emoji, and I sent one back.
                    Somehow, people turned that into a serious accusation and started calling me a pedophile / groomer.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    There was <strong>nothing sexual</strong> going on.
                    There was no grooming, no inappropriate behavior, and no hidden relationship.
                    People took a tiny moment out of context and exaggerated it into something disgusting and false.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    I genuinely do not understand why some people jumped to that conclusion, but I want to be very clear:
                    <strong>that accusation is false.</strong>
                </p>

                <h2 class="subheading">3) “Internet sister” being misread as dating</h2>
              <p class="essay-section">
                    The last thing is about internet family terms.
                    A lot of people online use words like “son,” “daughter,” “sister,” “brother,” “mom,” or “dad” in a completely non-romantic way.
                    This is a very common internet/social community thing, especially in friend groups, fandom spaces, Discord servers, and gaming communities.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    When people use those terms online, they usually mean <strong>closeness, trust, or friendship</strong> — not an actual family relationship,
                    and not a romantic relationship either.
                    It is often just a playful or affectionate way of saying “you are important to me” or “we are close friends.”
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    For example, people say things like “that is my internet sister” the same way they might say “that is my bestie” or “that is my online sibling.”
                    It is internet slang / internet culture language.
                    It does <strong>not</strong> automatically mean dating, flirting, or anything sexual.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    In my case, I asked someone to be my <strong>internet sister</strong>.
                    That was it.
                    It was not a dating request, and it was not sexual or romantic.
                    I was using a normal internet-family term the way many people do.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    But some people took that and twisted it into something it was not.
                    They acted like calling someone an internet sister must secretly mean I was trying to date them or be weird with them.
                    That is not true, and it ignores how people actually talk online.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    I never asked them out.
                    I never made it romantic.
                    I never asked for anything inappropriate.
                    It was a friendship term, not a dating term.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    This is exactly why context matters.
                    If you remove the context of internet culture and friendship language, you can make normal interactions sound suspicious when they are not.
                    That is what happened here.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    People need to stop assuming the worst just because they do not understand how some online communities talk.
                    “Internet sister” is not automatically romance, and it definitely is not proof of grooming.
                </p>

                <hr />

                <h2 class="subheading">What I am asking</h2>
                <p class="essay-section">
                    Please stop calling me a groomer over things that were not grooming.
                    These accusations are serious, and throwing them around carelessly hurts real people.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    If you care about safety online, then focus on actual predators and actual abuse.
                    There are real victims who need support, and real creeps who should be held accountable.
                    Making up or spreading false claims about me does not help anyone.
                </p>

                <p class="essay-section">
                    I am asking people to be fair, stop repeating rumors, and stop turning basic online interactions into something they were not.
